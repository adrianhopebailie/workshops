  <h1>Blockchain Workshop Position Statement</h1>
  <p><b>Author:</b> Ryan Shea (Blockstack Labs)</p>

  <h2>About the Author</h2>

  <p>Ryan Shea is Co-founder of Blockstack Labs &amp; co-creator of Blockstack, an application stack for decentralized, server-less apps secured by the blockchain.</p>

  <p>Onename, a consumer identity app built on top of Blockstack, was one of the earliest non-financial blockchain applications and remains the largest by transaction volume.</p>

  <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>

  <p>Blockstack Labs has produced and has been iterating on a variety of protocols in the areas of cryptography, identity, and blockchain technology, and has been collaborating with other individuals and organizations (including Consensys and Microsoft <a rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.blockstack.org/blockstack-labs-partners-with-microsoft-3ffccebf3f4f#.o9wn4g17i">blog.blockstack.org/blockstack-labs-partners-with-microsoft-3ffccebf3f4f#.o9wn4g17i</a>) Æ’in order to move them closer to becoming widely accepted standards.</p>

  <p>We are interested in collaborating with others on developing standards and have published protocols in the following areas:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Identity profiles</li>
    <li>Identity claims and attestations</li>
    <li>Elliptic curve keychains</li>
    <li>DNS resolution (including methods for resolution to immutable data)</li>
    <li>Authentication (including methods without identity providers)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To date we've worked with the following standards, either by (a) incorporating them in their original form, (b) extending them or (c) by using them as inspiration for our own protocols:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a rel="nofollow" href="http://schema.org">schema dot org</a></li>
    <li>JSON web tokens</li>
    <li>JSON-LD</li>
    <li>DNS zone files</li>
    <li>BIP44 hierarchical deterministic keychains</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We are also interested in the following areas:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>An HTTP API standard for a transaction broadcasting endpoint</li>
    <li>An HTTP API standard for HTTP 402 </li>
    <li>Payment Required using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Workshop Goals</h2>

  <p>Our goals for the workshop are to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Learn about and explore the areas of interest of the other participants</li>
    <li>Learn about the standards and protocols that participants are already working with</li>
    <li>Find common ground on our areas of interest</li>
    <li>Determine the areas where more experimentation is required and the areas that are ripe for the development of standards</li>
    <li>Work towards the development of standards in key areas of interest</li>
  </ul>
