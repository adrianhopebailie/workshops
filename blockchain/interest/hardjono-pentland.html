  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>Self-sourced (self-issued) identities offers a direction for solving privacy-preserving identity in large networks such as the new generation of blockchains currently being designed. Some cryptographic identity schemes offer strong privacy through identity anonymity and unlinkability of transactions. A new model for privacy-preserving identities is needed if blockchain systems are to operate at a global scale: it must allow entities in the ecosystem to (i) verify the "quality" or security of an identity, and (ii) to assess the relative "freedom" or independence of an identity from any given authority (e.g. government, businesses, etc.), and (iii) to assess the source of trust for a digital identity.</p>


  <h2>I.  Limited Scale of Current Self-Sourced Identities</h2>

  <p>Recent interest in the Bitcoin system <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-3">[3]</a>  has rekindled interest in the long-time problem of self-issued digital identities. The notion of self-issued identities was first posed in the mid-1990s in the context of self-signed X509 certificates, Simple PKI (SPKI) <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-2">[2]</a> and in the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) system <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>.</p>

  <p>We believe that a more accurate term for self-issued digital identities is "self-sourced" identities. What matters in digital identities is not so much the form of the identity (e.g. email-address; RSA public keys; X509 certificates <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-11">[11]</a>) but rather the source of trust for the provenance for the claimed identity.</p>

  <p>In the Bitcoin system, users self-generate (e.g. using software) public key pairs, and transact by using the key-pair.  The Bitcoin system uses the term "address" for their identities, which is simply a cryptographic hash of the public-key of the key-holder (i.e. holder of the matching private key). The address scheme in Bitcoin (hash of public-key) is functionally equivalent to the plain public-key.  The use of public-key ("address") in Bitcoin as an identity scheme provides some degree of anonymity to the key-holder at the expense of scalability. The identity scheme in Bitcoin can be used only within the Bitcoin system.</p>

  <p>This scalability limitation is also present in the PGP system <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>  where a user self-issues their PGP key-pair. The user as the key-holder must provide their PGP public-key directly to their friends and colleagues, either in-person or through a public "key ownership declaration" event (e.g. "PGP key signing parties" at IETF face-to-face meetings).</p>

  <p>Within the community of Bitcoin users and developers, one oft-cited positive feature of the system is the "anonymity" (pseudonymity) of key-holders through their use of self-sourced identities. In this line of thinking –- which we believe to be inherently self-limiting for scalability -– there is a perceived equivalence between anonymity (through the use self-sourced public-key pairs) and "independence from any trusted authority". </p>

  <p>Furthermore, the current self-issued digital identities (in the form of self-generated public-key pairs) does not scale because it lacks integration with existing infrastructures -- both digital infrastructures and real-world infrastructures.</p>


  <h2>II.  A New Model for Self-Sourced Identities</h2>

  <p>A complete and scalable identity management system needs to ground identity in the real world, and must not rely solely and unconditionally on existing identity/service providers. We believe a new model is needed for "self-sourced identities" that provide privacy-preservation as well as scalability at the global Internet level. </p>

  <p>A key feature of the new model is that it must allow entities in the ecosystem to (i) verify the "quality" or security of an identity, and (ii) to assess the relative "freedom" or independence of an identity from any given authority (e.g. government, businesses, etc.), and (iii) to assess the source of trust for a digital identity.</p>

  <p>If anonymity is a requirement for self-source identities to fulfill the needs of user privacy, then true anonymity in digital identities requires more than self-issuance of a public-key pair (as it is the case today in the Bitcoin system <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-3">[3]</a>). It requires that the identity also possess the feature of unlinkability or untraceability <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-6">[6]</a>. And even if a digital identity has anonymity, unlinkability, it still requires the relying party (counter-party) to accept the identity. That is, the relying party must be able to assess the provenance and source of trust of a given anonymous self-sourced identity.</p>

  <p>We believe a new model for digital identities for future blockchain systems is required, which is summarized in the following progressive steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Strong provenance attributes: Begin with an existing identity which has a high degree of source of trust, where attributes have a high degree of provenance. This identity maybe issued by an existing Identity Provider or other trusted third party operating within a legal jurisdiction (e.g. Bank, Government, Service Provider, etc.).</li>

    <li>Transitive source of trust: Use a privacy-preserving algorithm that translates the existing identity with strong provenance into an anonymous root-identity which carries-over the source of trust.</li>

    <li>Self-issued derived identities: Provide users with the freedom (and algorithms/tools) to self-issue anonymous transaction-identities, each of which is cryptographically derived from the user’s root-identity. The source of trust from the root-identity must also be carried-over into the derived transaction-identity.</li>

    <li>Privacy-preserving verification: Provide the Relying Parties (counter-party) with a privacy-preserving verification algorithms to validate the source of trust for any given (anonymous) transaction-identity. These verification algorithms must allow a relying party to establish a chain of provenance (from the self-issued transaction-identity all the way back to the origin attributes), while preserving the privacy of the owner of the identity.</li>

    <li>Legal Trust Framework (LTF): Establish an identity ecosystem for blockchain based on a LTF for anonymous root-identities and anonymous transaction-identities.</li>  
  </ol>
    
  <p>Our current efforts on the ChainAnchor system (see [4,5]) seeks to address these properties that are foundational to the proposed new model.</p>


  <h2>III.  Legal Trust Framework for Verifiable Self-Sourced Identities</h2>

  <p>A legal trust framework is a certification program that enables a party who accepts a digital identity credential (called the relying party) to trust the identity, security, and privacy policies of the party who issues the credential (called the identity service provider) and vice versa <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-8">[8]</a>.</p>

  <p>We believe the current LTFs as practiced in the industry (e.g. FICAM <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-7">[7]</a> , OIX <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-8">[8]</a>, SafeBioPharma <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-9">[9]</a>)  can be extended to introduce special type of identity providers, called the  Root-Identity Provider (RiP) and the  Root-Identity Verifier (RiV) <a rel="nofollow" href="#ref-10">[10]</a>.</p>

  <p>The Root-Identity Provider takes a user's existing identity which has a high degree of source of trust (step (1) above) and converts it using a privacy-preserving function into anonymous root-identity for the user (step (2) above). The user is then free to self-issue one or more anonymous transaction-identities to be used on the blockchain system with other users (relying parties).</p>

  <p>The Root-Identity Verifier provides a validation service to which a relying-party may inquire about the status and source-grade of a given anonymous transaction-identity (step (4) above) prior to transacting.</p>

  <p>In this context a LTF provides the following:</p>

  <ol class="lettered">
    <li>Network scalability: It allows any two parties to transact on the blockchain without prior engagement, thus achieving network scalability.</li>

    <li>Provenance assessment: It allows a relying-party (counter-party) to assess the "worthiness" (provenance and quality) of an anonymous transaction-identity prior to commencing the transaction;</li>

    <li>Cross-jurisdiction interoperability: It provides a legal foundation for anonymous root-identities and transaction-identities to be recognized in differing legal jurisdictions;</li>

    <li>New business models: It incentivizes service-providers (including the Root-Identity Providers and the Root-Identity Verifiers) to develop new business models around new scalable services;</li>

    <li>Risk assessment and risk management: It provides entities in the ecosystem with a means of legal recourse in unforeseen circumstances (e.g. attacks to the service; identity leaks; identity-data theft, provider negligence, etc.) as specified in the LTF operational contracts.</li>
  </ol>
