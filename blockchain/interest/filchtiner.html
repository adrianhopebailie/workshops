  <h2>Topical Idea for Workshop Development:</h2>

  <p>Create an asset repository for use cases of digital currency projects with the objective of illuminating:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>what would be optimal use cases of blockchains technologies;</li>

    <li>the business and technological ecosystems required to further the development and deployment of such technologies;</li>

    <li>identify policies and technical safeguards with respect to “smart-contracts” (general purpose programs that autonomously intermediate  transactions) regarding their implementation,  as well as, the possible emergence of “criminal smart-contracts” (in  the virtual world like theft of cryptographic keys and theft/leakage of  confidential information, to street-level crime, such as personal and  property injury, terrorism, etc).</li>
  </ol>
    
   <p>The ultimate goal would be the creation of a “repository clearinghouse" of  curated information on issues related to digital currency projects and their  related ecosystems.</p>
