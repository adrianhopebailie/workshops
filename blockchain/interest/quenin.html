  <h1>HTML Blockchain Event Types</h1>
  <p><b>Author:</b> Eileen Quenin (The Walt Disney Company)</p>

  <p>HTML Blockchain - Event types: specifically "Proof-of-Commit"</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Develop new HTML APIs to support transaction types of “proof-of-work”, “proof-of-stake”, “proof-of-storage” and “proof-of-commit”.</li>
    <li>Develop new set of elements methods, properties, and events that relate to DOM for blockchain protocol</li>
    <li>Define what html tags would be supported or added</li>
    <li>Define what file types would be supported</li>
    <li>Define what new form elements and input types might be required</li>

    <li>Proof-of-commit as incentive for participating in a web-based repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality in a transparent, responsive and irrefutable manner. Commits could be recorded on to a private blockchain and validated by the network (AI and human actors), ensuring only valid commits are accepted.</li>

    <li>Customizable smart contracts in the form of automatic static code analysis to identify and correct structural problems with the code to be committed. </li>
    <li>Customizable smart contracts time based execution or expiration of the code</li>

    <li>Create web interface into the smart contract showing passing criteria, due dates, software unit tests, interface requirements, language requirements, reward criteria definition, etc.</li>
    <li>Reward criteria – based on operational benchmarks, code execution speed, delivery bonus, quality of code, simplicity of code</li>
    <li>Create web interface for human actors to sign up and be involved participation for code reviewer </li>
    <li>Define designing incentive schemes, for “committers” to provide not only storage space but code validation</li>

    <li>Create interface and describe use APIs to connect decentralized cloud to host all repositories and commits and store data in a sparsely redundant way.  Provide Identity, Version Control and Policy in the form of smart contracts for use specifically by projects in the network and everyone has a meta-history of ledger. </li>

    <li>Every object published is sent to a redundant number of nodes.  There will be 2 phases for consensus and diversity check and final phase for audit and compliance checking.  The more objects you have in the system, the more spread out they are and the larger the network grows. The hash of each object, combined with the blockchain, will point to which set of nodes hold the data and each node will have roughly the same number of objects stored on it.</li>

  </ul>
