  <h1>Blockchain Workshop Position Statement</h1>
  <p><b>Author:</b> Samer Hassan (Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, Harvard University; Universidad Complutense de Madrid)</p>

  <p>I'm Samer Hassan (PhD), an activist and researcher, Fellow at the Berkman
  Center for Internet &amp; Society (Harvard University) and Assistant Professor
  at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain). I have carried out
  research in decentralized systems, social simulation and artificial
  intelligence from positions in the University of Surrey (UK) and the
  American University of Science &amp; Technology (Lebanon). Coming from a
  multidisciplinary background in Computer Science and Social Sciences, I
  have more than 45 publications in those fields (H-index=11). Engaged in
  free/open source projects, I co-founded the Comunes Nonprofit and the Move
  Commons webtool project, and have experience in multiple communities and
  grassroots initiatives. I'm involved as UCM Principal Investigator in the
  EU-funded P2Pvalue project on building decentralized webtools for
  Commons-based peer production.</p>

  <p>I have experience working with federated social networks and federated
  collaborative systems since 2009. I have been researching and experimenting
  with Blockchain since 2014, and I co-host the Berkman Center blockchain
  working group. I'm especially interested in smart contracts and the
  potentials of blockchain technologies for social good or large-scale
  cooperation, and would be happy to facilitate a discussion to understand
  the technical challenges to make that possible.</p>
