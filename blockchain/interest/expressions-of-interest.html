<th scope='row' id="ECohen">Cohen</th><td>Eric E.</td><td></td><td class='meta'>The world is looking to the Blockchain and related electronic distributed ledgers as a solution for a wide variety of challenges, calling it the “Global Ledger” and an immutable and secure audit trail. There are few others who have been as directly involved with global standards, academic, business, audit professional and government communities in discussing the need and attributes of an open, transparent, authentic, secure and semantically-rich distributed ledger and audit trail, especially as applied to corporate reporting, as I have.<br />
 <br />
As a co-founder of the XBRL consortium, focusing on revolutionizing the data, rules and processes of the corporate value &quot;information bus&quot; and the audit information supply chain, and as the Father of XBRL’s own &quot;Global Ledger&quot;, an XML-based specification for expressing a broad variety of transactional interactions in a standardized, holistic and generic fashion, I have been promoting a cryptographically-supported, semantically-rich, Web-available audit trail for over fifteen years, and have worked with virtually every community seeking to develop ledger interchange formats and protocols and related audit data standards internationally. This includes prior work with the OECD and present work with the ISO, and with the United Nations&#039; CEFACT effort as a domain coordinator over accounting and auditing standardization. These efforts focus both on data standardization and considerations of business rules, agreements, assertions, formulas and access rights throughout an audit trail or open business process.<br />
<br />
Along with semantic standards focusing on XML, I have been involved previously in the W3C’s security standards efforts with such an open, public and cryptographically supported anonymous audit trail in mind, contributing in particular to the initial development of XML Encryption and later providing use cases for continued considerations of XML Security, especially related to identity and digital signature issues. I have also been involved in a wide variety of signature and identity efforts with other standards and professional groups, in particular working through authorization, workflow and privacy issues of parties throughout the audit information supply chain.<br />
<br />
I have also heavily supported the academic community in its exploration of semantic and security standards for moving from document-centric to information-centric environments for continuous monitoring, reporting and auditing, and the practical use of the transparent and trustworthy audit trail as it is established.<br />
<br />
On Twitter, I am @Cybercpa, focusing on Blockchain and bluegrass, audit data standardization and humor.<br />
<br />
I am also an author and speaker on accounting technology topics; I wrote the first book about the Internet&#039;s relevance to accountants and the first article for the US accounting profession on the topic. I created one of the earliest web sites for accounting technology, which circumstances have not permitted me to maintain - http://www.computercpa.com.<br />

My firm&#039;s blockchain presence starts at http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/fintech/blockchain.html ; my opinions do not necessarily reflect those of my employer.<br />

More on identity issues related to electronic reporting at http://jebcl.com/symposium/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Communication-and-Integrity-of-Audit-Reports.pdf</td><td class='meta'>Broadly, I would like to contribute my somewhat unique background in audit, technology and data and security standardization to this vital effort. As noted above, I have been active in W3C, OASIS and numerous standards organizations to help make the vision of what might be accomplished by the Blockchain into reality.<br />
<br />
More specifically, although it is not my only interest, the audit information supply chain is a primary focus for me. Therefore, supporting the discussion of topics on simplifying access to information in the Blockchain and making appropriate content available to end users, while protecting the privacy of parties as appropriate throughout is a topic of particular interest.<br />
<br />
In the case of the corporate audit trail, the process begins with transactions for an organization being logged or captured in a blockchain, where those entries are controlled, authorized, complete and discoverable where appropriate.<br />
 <br />
Auditors’ identities, and authorization to act as auditors with appropriate attributes, might be captured in a blockchain (identity management). Different audit regulators (by region or by purpose) might maintain different blockchains, and some means of getting information across them may be necessary.<br />
<br />
Auditors would use the blockchain as a primary source of evidence. <br />
<br />
They would deliver their opinion on financial statements or other management assertions, where that association may be captured in a blockchain, capturing hashes of the financial statement and the auditor’s report (or the content itself) for stakeholders to be able to confirm the authorization of the auditor and the association with the report.<br />
<br />
Regulators would have an important role in this scenario, but let’s move to the investors; stakeholders would have access to the information in appropriate detail. <br />
<br />
Making that access &quot;actionable&quot;, the stakeholder may be able to receive a “token” as part of a smart contract for reviewing the materials for an appropriate period of time, and reliance on the auditor’s opinion may be anonymously captured; however, the stakeholder can prove that reliance at a later time if needed, for example, in court. <br />
<br />
Although the transactions would likely flow automatically, the other steps may benefit from personal interaction in a browser to find appropriate ledger entries, check identities, sign interactions, and assess and agree to or otherwise monitor the current status of smart contracts, amongst other tasks.</td><td class='meta'>I think the goals stated at https://www.w3.org/2016/04/blockchain-workshop/ are quite valid. Should Blockchain and electronic distributed ledgers live up to a fraction of their potential, standardizing the web-based interface may require ongoing consideration, starting soon, so that the &quot;right steps are taken at the right time&quot;.<br />
<br />
Related discussions are taking place in many other standards communities. The ISO is considering whether it should have a role in related standards - https://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&amp;articleid=c91c48a9-7c64-4a36-a76b-81eaa8c0923e and ISO/TC 68, the OMG Finance Domain and other communities are also exploring their role. </td><!-- MutExcStates --> <td title='Blockchain APIs, such as JavaScript or REST APIs: Don’t mind'>Don’t mind</td>

<td class='meta'>I feel I need to clarify my answer to &quot;Testing mechanisms&quot;, above. Confidence in blockchain systems - especially confidence in whether smart contracts will objectively and accurately perform their tasks - is an area of special interest to me, especially if third parties (e.g., auditors) might play a rule in the provision and communication and if Web design will help in that communication.</td><td class='meta'>Not wanting to be redundant, the features that Blockchain 1.0, smart contracts 1.0 and related agreements promise undergird the potential &quot;business Web&quot; that I have been promoting for over 15 years. Whether it is they they will succeed or some eventual successors, efforts around XML and Web security, URIs and other W3C recommendations seem highly relevant to the success of Blockchain implementation and considering their evolution in light of the many potential uses a valuable use of time and effort. </td></tr>

The block chain could contain only a sign post where to point to the displayed IP containing the actual file. Like youTube is a massive archive of IP, 300,000 uploads per minute!!!!! We need a way of making a NEW youTube (NewTube, this name is taken but for this demonstration I will use it) where the date/time stamp on the upload to official NewTube could be set in stone and not be untampered with/hacked, so the block chain could link to the url on NewTube. <br />
It could also point to the place where the full list of credits is stored in an IMDB type database, which is again verified by mechanisms of ID and trust mechanisms.<br />
<br />
3) Authenticate works as original by comparing with what is already in &#039;NewTube&#039; much like youTube Content ID does today. <br />
<br />
4) DO NOT LET GOOGLE control &#039;NewTube&#039;! It must be for the people by the people! Like Wipo or the Library of congress on steroids!<br />
<br />
5) Search engines can build on top to create smart contracts for automated sale and licensing. Giving a commission on sales to fund the Registry/archive.<br />
<br />
6) payment mechanism one click licensing offering various methods of payment. <br />
&#039;units&#039; on your phone bill or ISP bill<br />
or<br />
direct micro money payments via Pay Pal, Apple Pay, Google Pay , Mobile pay or even credit cards  if it can be made more easy and secure using a system of password and pass code which you enter 4 different digits out of 8 to make fraud more tricky etc etc<br />
<br />
NewTube will need bootstrapping, so needs startup finance and also needs to sustain itself. But a conventional tax on royalties is typically regressive so would need careful design to limit defection by high and low earners. There are people who could help <br />
design such a system.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also fundamentally believe that we will reach the singularity within 20 years and that this is an important time of transition into AI dominance and that how we programme the AI is very important. So by creating a system that respects humans teaches us and the AI to have a moral and humane conscience that I hope will be our salvation.</td></tr>

<td class='meta'>I am Tarique A Bhuiyan (pls call me TaB) and I am the Founder, Chairman and CTO of a Blockchain focussed technology start up called Hashkloud PTy Ltd based in Sydney, Australia. I am extremely pasionate about Blockchain technology and very strongly believe the technology will disrupt many industries especially services industries. My passion for Blockchain technology has led me to enroll myself on a Research Dotorate of Business Administration at an Australian university in part time under Australian Research Training Scheme. My current career goal is to become not only become an academically expert in Blockchain, but also professionally - a combination that is very much a sought after credential required to promote Blockchain as a technology.<br />
<br />
At Hashkloud, we have already developed a product (currently at Beta stage) which is a digital platform for customer KYC and Verification of their Identities powered by Blockchain. The idea behind is that we would like to create an internet of services where all service data and documents that relates to an individual will link back to that individual&#039;s identity and all verifiable via Blockchain while keeping the integrity and irrefutability of the identity and all other requests or instructions of the individual while applying for that service. <br />

Pls look at my Blockchain news and views aggregation services portal cum my Blogchain at www.hashledger.com. </td><td class='meta'>At Hashkloud, we are trying to come up with technologies powered by Blockchain to revolutionize services, any service. We are working on the concept of &#039;Internet of Services&#039;, more precisely &#039;Internet of Service Data and document objects&#039;. We believe that if we could create an ecosystem of documents and / or data objects required by various services, it is possible to create and ecosystem of inter-connected services thus making services delivery easier by the services organizations while at the same time creating fantastic service experiences for the service seekers. At the core of this ecosystem is the service data objects of service seekers&#039; identifications. Unless we have a framework of such ID data objects of the service seekers while still keeping the integrity, privacy, etc. of such data, it will be very difficult to attain such &#039;Internet of Services&#039; ecosystem. My goal to attend this workshop is to highlight this and get some standardized framework of service data object especially with regards to ID data objects of service seeking individuals or corporates powered by Blockchain technology.</td><td class='meta'>The outcome that I believe the workshop should focus on is to cme up with a framework of Identity systems powered by Blockchain technology while still keeping data privacy and integrity factors.</td><!-- MutExcStates --> <td title='Blockchain APIs, such as JavaScript or REST APIs: Ranked 7'>Ranked 7</td>

<td class='meta'>While the organizers are understandably keen to avoid too much discussion of payment technologies at the workshop, my experience with building and deploying web payments systems is highly relevant to the task at hand.  I was lead architect and software developer of the nCipher payShield HSM which was built specifically to service the emerging 3DSecure/SecureCode market, a standard aimed at bringing physical cards onto the web.  In designing and building this product I discovered serious flaws in the card schemes’ original cryptographic protocol designs which were fine in the context of the EMV walled garden but unsuited and potentially vulnerable in the web context.  <br />
<br />
Later in my career as Chief Technology Officer at Trustonic I brought security to large-scale natively online applications in a variety of use cases including sensitive online identities, multi-party trust, bitcoin wallets and blockchain platform companies.  Practical issues in the areas of standardization, deployment and usability are legion and in order to get something to market compromises have to be made at almost all levels of the stack.<br />
<br />
Now in my current role I am actively handling many projects and products in a wide range of industries at all stages of ‘digital transformation’ as they transition security-sensitive operations to the cloud, to web, and more.  Blockchain is high on the agenda for many of these conversations, and the requirements vis-à-vis permissioning, form factors, confidentiality and legals are highly varied. <br />
<br />
Appreciation of cryptography ‘in context’ is going to be essential in making web-accessible general blockchain standards practical.  I intend to bring this experience to the workshop.  <br />

<th scope='row' id="Stephanie">Stephanie</th><td>Potter</td><td></td><td class='meta'>I am a research coordinator at State Street Bank.  Currently, my team and I are creating a machine learning based platform for organizing and suggesting sell side research to institutional investors. Our team falls under a larger group called innovation ventures which houses blockchain consortium efforts, social media sentiment analysis for stock performance, new efforts within big data management as well as investing or acquiring financial technology startups. <br />
<br />
Within the past year I have gone to a handful of conferences, primarily in San Francisco and Cambridge on new technologies within finance. All of the conferences have had panels on leveraging blockchain to house digitally native asset classes and loan agreements.<br />
<br />
Although I have researched blockchain technologies in finance for over a year, I have recently become more interested in the idea of a blockchain based identity management system. After listening to a presentation on Ethereum at a financial conference I began to do research on how Ethereum could change identities are used online. <br />
<br />
My personal research has lead me to believe that creating an identity system could be a major step towards more efficient international research endeavors especially in medicine, genetically modified organisms, nanotechnology and robots/drones. To enable this I believe large corporations, such as my own, have a role to promote interoperability through supporting and assisting to create identity management systems.<br />
<br />
Legal disclaimer: This is my personal opinion and not the official position of my company.</td><td class='meta'>My primary goal for the workshop is to identify how large institutions (especially banks, such as the one that I work for) can support interoperability and blockchain based identity management systems. In the short term I would like to create a narrative on the role of large corporations in supporting a blockchain based identity management to galvanize efforts on defining the changing role of fiduciary relationships.<br />
<br />
My secondary goal is to contribute to and gain deeper thought on the ethical basis needed for identity management systems to contribute to an enlightened democratic society. <br />
Questions that surround this should define where we, as a society, draw the line on the information large companies or governments need from it’s clients or citizens to facilitate innovation and healthy societies. If we create an identity system that gives the users autonomy over their information, but society does not have a strong opinion on the dangers of oligarchies in the digital age, both in government and businesses, democracy and free thought will still be at risk.<br />
For example- if in the future an identity management system was adopted, and large insurance corporations could not unknowingly collect information on its clients, but instead had to gain permission from the clients to access deeper personal information by offering incentives to the client - the risk of oligarchy would still be present. The insurance company in this example could make it too financially burdensome for the client to withhold their private information.<br />
<br />
Legal disclaimer: This is my personal opinion and not the official position of my company.</td><td class='meta'>create a narrative on what is going on in blockchian and how it relates to the future of information and relationships that is marketable.<br />
The narrative should include a philosophy component, possibly Locke and/or Madison; be defined by the major discourses within technological abilities and challenges - not generally agreed upon ideas about blockchain; who specifically is needed to advance efforts in interoperability and identity management for next steps to unfold eg. Government officials, businesses, universities; and how members of the W3C event can group together to be influential thought leaders.<br />

Martin Kurze, Director Research &amp; Innovation at T-Labs (Deutsche Telekom), is working on innovative and disruptive topics of the web-ecosystem since about 20 years, starting with web3D (VRML97) and advanced user centric ID-management approaches to web-based mobile operating systems (mainly Firefox OS). The current focus of his work is on privacy and security technologies in mobile and web context. Inside T-Labs he is leading a number of Privacy (and security) based innovation projects, some of them as consortial projects. His approach is to use technology to make the (open, web based) world a better place, leveraging the latest technology in a constructive pro-active manner (in contrast to traditional privacy approaches).<br />

<td class='meta'></td><td class='meta'>My Position (not necessarily DT&#039;s position):<br />
While the World-Wide-Web is a service running on the internet with (basically) no central administration and no built-in privacy (or accountability), the telco industry is built on top of very powerful accounting capabilities: Telcos usually know (or at least can know) their users and the respective usage contexts. They use this knowledge to do &quot;AAA&quot; (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) which is the telco business&#039; core competence. <br />
This results in many business opportunities and use cases where similar properties are required. In the Blockchain context, I want to highlight two of those properties with an (assumed) synergy potential:<br />
Reputation and<br />
Provable ledger transaction history<br />
Both are currently implemented (or inherently included) in telco business models and technical product portfolios. Both can be disruptively replaced or positively enhanced by Blockchain technology.<br />
<br />
To further strengthen telco companies (at least the modern and agile ones) and to make Blockchain based models a success story for the end user, a strong and independant standardization force is needed. W3C and the web community can drive this standardization of Blockchain technology, infrastructure and means of operation.<br />
Web and telco capabilities perfectly complement each other. In some cases the approaches of the &quot;open web&quot; and the &quot;anonymous internet user&quot; seem to contradict the very much regulated and controlled word of the telco industry and also with the need for trust, be it immaterial (= reputation) or material (e.g. financial).<br />
End users as well as industries and businesses rely on these types of trust (and try to build both of them).<br />
End users tend to request contradictory features, or they have different goals in different situations/times. E.g. a user might want to pay for a service anonymously but he wants to prove certain claims in different situations. And sometimes he might want to act anonymously and later on decide that disclosing and proving his identity might be desired.<br />
Businesses (including personal businesses) request a transaction safe system that allows fast and reliable transactions that can be audited and proven if necessary.<br />
Blockchains may help to combine all the different requirements and approaches. I suggest to address two of those in parallel and thus cover two &quot;opposite ends&quot; of the spectrum of blockchain uses cases:<br />
Provide provable reputation (and reputation history) in three flavours based the same blockchain: anonymous, pseudonymous and personalized (optionally also applicable for small and medium enterprises). <br />
Provide provable transaction history with no dedicated and permanently accessible &quot;trust center/certification authority&quot;, but based on a &quot;company-issued&quot; blockchain where the company could be a trusted high-reputation telco.<br />
The web and the W3C would play an essential role in both use cases, providing the open and standardized infrastructure and building on top of the numerous previous experiences with open, user-oriented yet industry friendly standards and practices.<br />
This workshop should give all of us (telcos, W3C, end users) a clearer view on the opportunities and probabilities of success for collaborative approaches like this.<br />
