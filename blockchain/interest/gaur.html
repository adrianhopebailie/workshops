  <h1>Blockchain Workshop Position Statement</h1>
  <p><b>Author:</b> Nitin Gaur (IBM Blockchain Labs)</p>

  <h2>Topic Proposal:</h2>

  <h3>Considering blockchain for Enterprise?</h3>

  <p>Blockchain technology can be used to record virtually anything of value - your identity, a will, a deed, or almost any type of secure transfer of information. But in many respects, Blockchain is lacking some critical capabilities to make it ready for widescale adoption by business. This session on IBM Blockchain attempts to uncover  the promise of blockchain for enterprise, which goes beyond its role as an industry disruptor. It also has tremendous potential to improve existing business processes, as well as to improve efficiencies in existing transaction systems, leading to exponential cost saving for the enterprise and the end consumer. Disintermediation and disruption is the investment magnet for blockchain-related ideas, riding on the success of the business and underpinned by peer-to-peer and crowdsourcing models Blockchain technology promises a similar explosion in trade, ownership, and trust, as the tenets of both technologies rely on principles of distributed governance and rules established for a time-tested protocol. Focus on Enterprise adoption including KYC, AML, Logging, audit and standardized protocol/technology stack including Hyperledger and other competing frameworks.</p>
