  <h1>Blockchain Workshop Position Statement</h1>
  <p><b>Author:</b> Patrick Adler, <br>
  Chief Architect â€“ FedLine
  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago
  </p>

  <p>I would like to register to attend the upcoming W3C Blockchain workshop.  Due to the nature of my employer and my role,  I cannot provide a formal position on Blockchain.  While I cannot provide a formal position statement on behalf of my employer, I would still like to request the ability to attend the upcoming workshop.  I have been closely involved in W3C standards work related to both payments, identities and the interledger community group, and additionally serve as the current Advisory Committee representative for my organization. I am personally interested in a number of different aspects and applications of blockchains and how they will impact/influence the web platform and the financial industry more broadly.  Having worked in the financial industry for close to 20 years on a wide range of technology platforms, I also feel I can bring broad perspective and insights to the discussion.</p>

  <p>I welcome any questions that the Program Committee may have regarding my qualifications and interest in the workshop and look forward to hearing your favorable reply.</p>
