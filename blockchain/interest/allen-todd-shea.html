  <h1>Smarter Signatures: Options to Ensure Fiduciary Protection on the Web</h1>

  <p>by Christopher Allen, Peter Todd, and Ryan Shea</p>

  <h3>Position Statement</h3>

  <p>Signatures are important to web technologies because they're what map human
  identities to public keys and their cryptographic identities. They're a
  critical link for creating security and preserving privacy on the web.
  However, smart signatures can do even more. Multisignatures allow several
  people to sign together. Signature delegation supports one person signing
  for someone else — for a short period of time, for limited situations, or
  for more extensive usage. Generally, smart signatures can be used to map
  not just human <i>identities</i> on the web, but also human
  <i>relationships</i>. This is especially important in a web-based world
  where fiduciary transactions requiring a high level of trust are regularly
  conducted through browsers.</p>

  <p>Despite their importance, signatures aren't a well-understood or
  well-integrated part of current web technologies. Something needs to change.</p>

  <p>To create smarter "fiduciary" signatures require new signature technologies
  that meet five core criteria for fiduciary responsibility. They must be
  <i>deterministic</I>, always returning the same results; they must be
  <I>efficient</I>, cheaply offering their results; they must be
  <i>bounded</I>, preventing DOS attacks; they must be <i>composable</I>,
  supporting complexity with constrained opcodes; and they must be
  <i>inspectable</I>, allowing for easy understanding.</p>

  <p>Functional programming languages provide a sound basis for these technical
  requirements. However, there are a number of different options within that
  category, offering the opportunity for considerable discussion on the topic.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><i>Bitcoin Script.</i> Obviously, the constrained Bitcoin Script
  language is already used as the basis of signatures in Bitcoin. Extending
  the existing Bitcoin Script system provides the opportunity for complex
  signatures of the sort needed for fiduciary smart signatures while still
  maintaining the important constraints of the existing Script language.
  Johnson Lau's BIP 114 demonstrates one possible way to do so.</li>

    <li><i>Other Forth-like Languages.</i> If Bitcoin Script proves too
  constrained (or too static), a fiduciary smart signature language could
  instead be created by going back to the core foundation of Bitcoin Script:
  Forth. Alternatively, Joy might be an interesting variant. Like Bitcoin
  Script, Forth and Joy offer the advantages of languages built on the
  composition of functions.</li>

    <li><i>Lambda Languages.</I> Finally, a fiduciary smart script language
  cold instead be built on a lambda calculus. Peter Todd has already been
  exploring this option with "Dex", a Deterministic Predicate Expression
  language.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Though the choice of a functional back end for fiduciary smart contracts is
  important, integration with a web front end may be just as critical. Most
  users will be accessing web browsers and ID wallets to view fiduciary smart
  signatures and to inspect their validity. The integration of HTTPS services
  into the web has already shown that minor changes to how a browser displays
  a secure (or insecure!) connection, and how it explains those results, can
  make large differences in whether users accept those connections — and thus
  the ultimate security of the internet. A strong smart signature system
  <i>requires</i> excellent web UI design to offer meaningful security, which
  offers another topic for discussion.</p>

  <p>This is all just the first step toward better security for fiduciary
  activities on the web. Further questions, such as how to link asynchronous
  oracles and blockchain backends into the web and how to allow revocation,
  are also crucial.</p>

  <p>Though the problems may be difficult, the end result of improved security
  on the web remains an important and worthwhile goal.</p>

  <h3>About the Discussion Leader</h3>

  <p>Christopher Allen is the co-author of the IETF TLS 1.0 standard for the
  web. He has also been deeply involved with blockchain technologies in
  recent years, including teaching at Blockchain University and working at
  Blockstream as Principal Architect. He has hosted two design workshops on
  Rebooting the Web of Trust; he worked with Ryan Shea on a white paper about
  Smart Signatures for the first workshop and offered suggestion to Peter
  Todd for an advanced reading on Smarter Signatures at the second workshop.</p>
