  <h1>Blockchain Workshop Position Statement</h1>
  <p><b>Author:</b> Mountie Lee (PayGate)</p>

  <p>I have started W3C activity with Web Cryptography Working Group to propose
  PKI standard to W3C at 2012 (see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sangraecho.github.io/WebCert/WebCertAPI-1011.html">http://sangraecho.github.io/WebCert/WebCertAPI-1011.html</a>) and found it is valuable to share knowledge and contributing to community:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>sequencially start to contribute to Web Payments Interest group and Working
    Group</li>
    <li>forming internal support group in Korea</li>
    <li>suggested payment industries (like Samsung Pay) join to Web Payments WG.</li>
    <li>will keep to contribution on Web Payments IG/WG</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Also I found strong requirement to standardize blockchain related standard and suggested to start <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/community/blockchain/">W3C Blockchain Community Group</a>.</p>

  <p>I also leading Fintech Industry in Korea under Korea Fintech Forum (PayGate is chair company of this forum) which has subgroups including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>blockchain</li>
    <li>P2P lending</li>
    <li>International remittance</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The mission of Blockchain Community Group is as following:</p>

  <p>“The mission of the the Blockchain Community Group is to generate message
  format standards of Blockchain based on ISO20022 and to generate guidelines
  for usage of storage including torrent, public blockchain, private
  blockchain, side chain and CDN. This group will study and evaluate new
  technologies related to blockchain, and use cases such as interbank
  communications.”</p>

  <p>Under the Blockchain CG, I have leaded following activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenKeyChain Proposal: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/shepelt/openkeychain-spec">https://github.com/shepelt/openkeychain-spec</a></li>
    <li>Weekly Conference call to share understandings and improvements</li>
    <li>formulated initial CG workshop (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/community/blockchain/workshop-report-at-25mar2016/">https://www.w3.org/community/blockchain/workshop-report-at-25mar2016/</a>)</li>
    <li>prepare seminar for ISO20022 with swift</li>
    <li>develop storage usage with blockchain</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I hope to share more understandings and knowledges at W3C Workshop.</p>
