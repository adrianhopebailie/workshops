## IPFS Project has produced a number of small formats and protocols that very useful for distributed and crypto systems

* Juan Benet: The IPFS Project has produced a number of small formats and protocols that very useful for distributed and crypto systems. I will prepare a short (5m) overview presentation on these. They include: The Multispecs - self describing formats for protocol and cryptographic agility (multihash, multiaddr, multikey, multicodec, multistream); IPLD - a standard hash-linked data interchange format. IPLD is a great way to represent hash-linked datastructures (IPFS, Blockchains, Git, FSes, JSON-LD, ...);  libp2p - standard peer-to-peer network protocol stack and libraries. All formats and protocols discussed are used by millions of users, and have many implementations in Go, Javascript, Python, Rust, Clojure, and more.

"Building the infrastructure of the future (decentralized) web"

Colleagues Jutta and Tomek will talk about their vision for the future (decentralized) web at ethcore.io.  Jutta and Tomek will present and demo the tools they have developed so far for secure transaction signing and identity management.  Jutta and Tomek will also discuss the challenges they faced when integrating these tools with the existing browser infrastructure."
